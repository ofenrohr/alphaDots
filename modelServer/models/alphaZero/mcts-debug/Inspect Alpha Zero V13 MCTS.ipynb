    "On the board there are two short chains on the right, one short chain in the middle and a long chain on the left. The winning move is to connect the long chain on the left with the short chain in the middle to create a chain made of 6 boxes. Our opponent will then have to make a move in either one of the other two short chains. We take that short chain, open the other one and finally get the 6 box long chain, thus winning the game.\n",

It might be possible that the value was generated with the old method in the StageFour data generator that used the Hard AI to complete the game after MCTS made its move - the new version takes the value of the selected Monte-Carlo tree node. So maybe MCTS calculates a value that is inferior? But even if that is the case, the training data has a good value and resulted in bad results. After all, we examine V13_SP which was trained on the presented data.\n",

    "The only winning move is to make a preemtive sacrifice by drawing line 7. The Monte-Carlo tree has the highest value for move 7, but has a higher visit count for line 14. That's rather bad, because line 14 is a half-hearted handout, which most probably is wrong in any given situation and not only in this instance. When we make a half-hearted handout, we open a short chain on one of its ends. As a result, our opponent can choose to either capture the chain or apply double-dealing. Offering our opponent a choice is a very bad idea, because it gives away control of the game without gaining any advantage.\n",
